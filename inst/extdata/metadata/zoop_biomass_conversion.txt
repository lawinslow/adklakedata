Type				type of zooplankton, either rotifer or crustacean
Genus				taxonomic information
Species				taxonomic information
Equation			length - weight equation
coefficient_a			first coefficient of equation
coefficient_b			second coefficient of equation (typically exponent)
L_mm				standard length in mm of each species. See in variable ‘Measurment_notes’ for details on where these values
W_mm				standard width in mm of each species. See in variable ‘Measurment_notes’ for details on where these values
ug_WWperind			micrograms of wet weight per individual based on the equation and standard measurements or other published dataset
Reference_for_formula		publication reference for formula form and coefficient
Measurement_notes		notes on where the standard length and width measurements are from; "measurements from NTL LTER data set" indicate 					measurements are average lengths for each species over the 1982-2015 data record from the North Temperate Lakes Long-term 				Ecological Research (https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/)
