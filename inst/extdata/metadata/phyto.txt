date			date of measurement in YYYY-MM-DD format
year			year of measurement, four digit format

num.naturalunits.counted	number of natural units counted for each unique species on given sampling event
num.cells.counted			number of cells counted for each unique species on given sampling event
biovol.um3.per.cell			biovolume of cell for each unique species in cubic micrometers per cell
cells.per.ml				cells per ml for each unique species on given sampling event
biovol.um3.per.ml			biovolume per ml for each unique species on given sampling event. Assuming a density 1mm^3/1mg (Ejsmont-Karabin, 1998) this is the same value as mg wet weight per L (mgWW/l) which is used for biomass estimates for zooplankton.
