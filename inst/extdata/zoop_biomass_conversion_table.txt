Type					type of zooplankton, either rotifer or crustacean
Genus					Taxonomic information
Species					Taxonomic information
Equation				length - weight equation
coefficient_a			first coefficient of equation
coefficient_b			second coefficient of equation (typically exponent)
L-mm					standard length in mm of each species. See in Measurment_notes for details on where these values
W_mm					standard width in mm of each species. See in Measurment_notes for details on where these values
ug_WWperind				micrograms of wet weight per individual based on the equation and standard measurements or other published dataset
Reference_for_formula	publication reference for formula form and coefficient
Measurement_notes		notes on where the standard length and width measurements are from; "measurements from NTL LTER data set" indicate measurements are average lengths for each species over the 1982-2015 data record from the North Temperate Lakes Long-term Ecological Research (https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/)
